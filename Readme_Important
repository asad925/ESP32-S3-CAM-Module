⚠️ Important Configuration

Before compiling and uploading the code, configure the correct camera model and board settings.

In your sketch, uncomment:

#define CAMERA_MODEL_ESP32S3_EYE // Has PSRAM


In the Arduino IDE, select:

Board: ESP32 S3 Dev Module

PSRAM: Enabled

These settings are required for correct pin mapping, camera operation, and stable image buffering.
Using different options may cause camera initialization failures or boot issues.
